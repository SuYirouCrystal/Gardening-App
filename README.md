## Overview  
The **garden** module is a Next.js–based sub-application within the Gardening-App monorepo, built with the App Router for file-based routing and server components to deliver SEO-friendly, high-performance pages. It enables users to maintain a plant catalog, schedule watering, and visualize growth analytics via React components and Tailwind CSS.

  – Create, edit, and delete plant profiles (species, planting date, care notes).  
- **Watering Scheduler**  
  – Log watering events and get plant-specific schedule recommendations.  
- **Growth Analytics Dashboard**  
  – Interactive charts showing historical growth metrics (client-side components with recharts).  
- **Responsive Design**  
  – Fully responsive layouts powered by Tailwind CSS breakpoints and utility classes.

## Prerequisites  
- **Node.js** ≥18 (LTS)  
- **npm** ≥8 or **Yarn** ≥1.22
